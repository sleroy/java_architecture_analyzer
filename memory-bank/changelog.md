## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-10

### ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE: Complete Inspector Foundation

This release represents a significant architectural achievement - all 6 originally missing inspector base classes have been implemented, providing a complete foundation for Java code analysis.

### Added
- **Complete Inspector Base Class Hierarchy**: Implemented all missing inspector base classes
  - `RegExpFileInspector`: Pattern matching with validation and comprehensive error handling
  - `CountRegexpInspector`: Pattern occurrence counting with robust match logic
  - `TextFileInspector`: Full content extraction with abstract processContent method
  - `JavaParserInspector`: Ready for AST-based Java parsing implementations
  - `BCELInspector`: Apache BCEL bytecode analysis foundation
  - `JavassistInspector`: Runtime bytecode manipulation base class
  - `RoasterInspector`: Code generation and manipulation base (bonus)
  - `SonarParserInspector`: Advanced parsing with SonarSource integration (bonus)

### Changed
- **Major Package Restructuring**: Reorganized inspector classes into logical hierarchy
  - Moved base classes from flat structure to organized `core/` packages
  - `inspectors/core/binary/`: All binary analysis base classes
  - `inspectors/core/source/`: All source analysis base classes
  - `inspectors/rules/`: Concrete inspector implementations
  - `inspectors/packages/`: Package-level analysis inspectors

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: All new inspector base classes implement consistent error handling
  - Return `InspectorResult.error()` instead of throwing exceptions
  - Comprehensive validation for all constructor parameters
  - Graceful handling of null inputs and edge cases

### Technical Details
- **Template Method Pattern**: All base classes follow consistent template method implementation
- **Resource Management**: Proper try-with-resources and stream handling throughout
- **Validation**: Input validation for regex patterns, null checks, and parameter validation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JavaDoc for all new base classes

### Architecture Impact
- **Extension Points**: Developers now have 11 total base inspector classes to extend from
- **Plugin System**: All new base classes compatible with existing plugin loading mechanism
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and generics usage throughout the inspector hierarchy
