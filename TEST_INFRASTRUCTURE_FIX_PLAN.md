# Test Infrastructure Fix Plan: ASM Inspector Test Setup

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: 45 test failures due to ASM-based binary inspectors receiving invalid mock bytecode instead of real compiled bytecode.

**Root Cause**: Tests provide minimal byte arrays (`0xCAFEBABE` magic number only) but ASM's `ClassReader` requires complete, valid Java class file structure.

**Example**: `EjbCreateMethodUsageInspectorTest` creates mock bytecode:
```java
private byte[] createMockEntityBeanBytecode() {
    // This is insufficient for ASM processing!
    return new byte[] { (byte) 0xCA, (byte) 0xFE, (byte) 0xBA, (byte) 0xBE };
}
```
